### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**I am a passionate trainer, coach and mentor with over a 8+ years of experience in training, working professional and fresh graduate on various technologies. I am working for reputed multinationals for more than 8 years, currently, I am working as a RPA solution architect for various companies. I have also authored in various International conferences. I am about creative problem-solving. My forte is to adventure, but not beyond prudently practicable boundaries. To use learning taken from miscellaneous disciplines of study, congenially and harmoniously, in whatever working projects I am dealing with. This, then is a chief aim and resource of mine. I expect rigor from my teams. Technically so and in their administrator procedures. By which they lay out the records of their days work. Pressing further oneâ€™s personal limits, and ones.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
